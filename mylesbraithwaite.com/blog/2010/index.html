<p>Flamingo is Brandon Flowers&#8217; (frontman for The Killers) debut solo album released on the 14th September, 2010. One thing I would like to get out in the open is that I am kind of a closet Killers fan, it almost seems &#8220;uncool&#8221; to like&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>The first time I heard them was on a television show called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_O.C." title="Wikipedia page for The O.C.">The <span class="caps">O.C.</span></a> (an american teen drama about a bunch of high school kids in Orange County having way to many problems) I think it was the second session or something (a little bit after their album <em>Hot Fuss</em> which was released in June of 2004). Anyways they sounds was of reminiscent of the time (which was 2004) kind of a mix between mainstream pop and Indie rock but new enough to be consider different. I was in high school at the time and the songs <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGdGFtwCNBE" title="YouTube music video of Mr. Brightside by The Killers">Mr. Brightside</a> and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1p_NHFd8jM" title="YouTube music video of Smile Like You Mean It by The Killers">Smile Like You Mean It</a> helped with though stupid teenage angst (mostly about girls (I listened to The Clash for my more against the current war in Afghanistan and Iraq&nbsp;angst)).</p>
<p>Their second album <em>Sam&#8217;s Town</em> (which I consider their best), released on 2nd October, 2006 was an almost love song about Las Vegas (Sam&#8217;s Town being a casino they frequent played at (I know that because I saw a really freaking awkward MuchMusic interview with Leah Miller)). Everything about this album seemed almost grown up (maybe because it came out a couple of days after I dropped out of college). That entire winter I would sing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ff0oWESdmH0&amp;ob=av3e" title="YouTube music video of When You Were Young by The Killers">When You Were Young</a> every day in the shower. It was voted the most underrated album of the year by the Rolling Stone (and at that time that publication actually meant&nbsp;something).</p>
<p><em>Sawdust</em> (released on 9th November, 2007) and <em>Day <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Age</em> (18 November, 2008) were really terrible (okay <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hc16Y9fiCvQ">Spaceman</a> on Day <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Age and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygfKqUgw5x4">Glamorous Indie Rock <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Roll</a> were good songs (and their cover of Dire Straits Romeo and Juliet was pretty cool too)). Both albums felt like they were pushed out to keep them relevant (when the next k-os album gets released I will go more in depth about this idea of pushing out an album before it was ready in another blog post, if I forget please email me). But I moved on my then and was a different person. The entire group seems tired (mainly from being on a non-stop tour for the last four&nbsp;years).</p>
<p>Um&#8230;&#8230;.. Brandon Flowers new solo album Flamingo. When I bought this album I had an interesting conversation with the girl at <span class="caps">HMV</span>. We talked about how we would liked to see both Brandon Flowers and The Killers succeed mainly for the fact is that they seem normal. The one that that MuchMusic interview told me (and by the way she actually remembered it too which was kind of cool) is these guys have the feeling of accidentally famous. I get this feeling that they kind of want to be in the good old days playing in Clubs in Las Vegas. Every song on the album lyrics are almost pop music clichés and you know how I feel about pop music clichés but as <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/17385/196896" title="Rolling Stone review of Flamingo - Brandon Flowers by Jody Rosen">Rolling Stone</a> (which isn&#8217;t really doesn&#8217;t mean anything anymore) puts it &#8220;you&#8217;ll be too busy singing along to giggle&#8221;. If anything for me Flamingo brings me back when I was 17-18 just out of school and not quite in college. It wont be my favourite album of 2010 but it is definitely worth in the top&nbsp;twenty.</p>

		<p>We are living in a world where the average person is carrying at least three portable computing devices. Okay maybe not the average person but most days I have three portable computing devices with me; a laptop, cell phone, and tablet. Usually these devices have some sentience information; contacts, calendar, personal photos, documents, contracts, banking information, etc. During last nights <a href="http://gtalug.org/" title="Greater Toronto Linux User Group"><span class="caps">GTALUG</span></a> <a href="http://gtalug.org/wiki/Meetings:2010-08" title="Linux Urban Street Hacking with William Porquet">meeting</a> we had a brief audience chat on dealing your portable device when it is outside the confront of your home. So i thought I would share my two&nbsp;cents.</p>
<p>Similar to sex absents is the safe way not to lose your computer and data (just ask an <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/technology/ihnatko/2178822,ihnatko-apple-iphone-engadget-gizmodo.article" title="How Gizmodo got the biggest iPhone scoop of all">iPhone engineer</a>). If you can&#8217;t live without your computer then do some serious auditing of your data. Do you need to carry around your personal (and corporate) accounting ledger, business contacts, calendar, proprietary source code, <span class="caps">SSH</span> keys, contacts, and other sensitive information. Also what I find helps is giving everything a value of money. For example I might have some source code for a client project I have been working on for sixty billable hours and haven&#8217;t got paid yet. That would have a high monitory value, unlike an open source project. Something I should start doing is physically locking my laptop with a <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B001911ZRQ?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mylesbrait0b-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=15121&amp;creative=390961&amp;creativeASIN=B001911ZRQ">security lock</a> (they are reality cheap compared to my laptop and it&#8217;s&nbsp;data).</p>
<p>Backup, Backup, Backup. I am not going to go to much into this but have some sort of offsite backup system installed and working. Mine is a combination of Git/Hg, <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTU3ODAwMjk">Dropbox</a>, and&nbsp;S3.</p>
<ul>
<li>If I am working on a proposal it is saved to my&nbsp;Dropbox.</li>
<li>If I am working on code it is pushed to a remote&nbsp;computer.</li>
<li>If I can&#8217;t push to a remote computer (<span class="caps">SSH</span> is blocked) I push to an S3&nbsp;bucket.</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Encrypt your laptops hard&nbsp;drive.</p>
<p>Most enterprisy companies have remote wipe on Blackberry&#8217;s Enterprise Server, make sure you can have the same. The iPhone supports this though MobileMe and Android has <a href="https://www.wavesecure.com/">WaveSecure</a> if you data is worth more than $200 these services are very beneficial. Also never be afraid of doing a remote wipe, backup your phone at least once or twice a week and use services that have some type of push to &#8220;the cloud&#8221; feature (I use SimpleNote which sends my notes to a remote web&nbsp;service).</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t be paranoid, the majority of the people in this world are honest and good. If you have something telling them how to contact you if you device get lost, they will contact you. Just make sure they can easily find your&nbsp;information.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think I have ever written a review in my life but I just have to say how much I freaking (trying to stop swearing) hate my <a href="http://sonystyle.ca/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=20153&amp;catalogId=100803&amp;langId=200&amp;productId=8198552921665520560">Sony <span class="caps">MDR</span>-<span class="caps">NC7</span> Noise Canceling Headphones</a>.</p>
<p>When I bought this product it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxing_Day">Boxing Day</a> 2009 (if you are not from the Commonwealth Boxing Day is the day after Christmas when stores have everything they couldn&#8217;t sell on sale) at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkdale_Shopping_Centre">Yorkdale</a>. I hate malls, but for some screwed up reason the only time I go to malls is on Boxing Day, usually with my Stepmom, Beth, I don&#8217;t know why I have an issue with crowds and I have a mild form of claustrophobia. But I digress so I am in the Sony Store (or Sony Style they have both) looking to purchase another pair of headphones, I already own a pair of the awesome old faction <a href="http://www.bose.ca/controller?url=/shop_online/headphones/audio_headphones/around_ear_headphones/index.jsp">Bose around-ear headphones</a> (which I would recommend to anyone looking to purchase headphones), for the <span class="caps">TTC</span> (the Toronto Subway). So I picked up the Sony equivalent that was about thirty dollars (a lot cheaper than the Bose but if I broke them or some how dropped them it wouldn&#8217;t be an issue). When I got the the checkout the girl behind the counter suggested that I buy these Noise Canceling Headphones for the same price because they <strong>would cancel out the noise</strong> of the subway cars, streetcars, and bus. So on her recommendation I bought&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t expect the Noise Canceling to work that while, I remember that my <a href="http://bruce.braithwaite.ca/">Dad</a> purchase a pair two years back to listen to his iPod on the airplane. He said they cut out most of that air sounding stuff that you get on airplanes but he could hear the flight attendants and the pilot over the intercom. But when I got onto my first subway ride I could barley hear any music. So I started to turn up the volume; I could feel the bass on my ears but I couldn&#8217;t hear any&nbsp;music.</p>
<p>If you want really Noise Canceling Headphones I suggest buying a pair of Around Ear Headphones, or those Inner Ear ones (but those have&nbsp;dangers).</p>

		<p><a href="http://gravitymad.com/">Travis Millward</a> <a href="http://mylesbraithwaite.com/projects/django-quiz/#c195">commented</a> on my <a href="http://mylesbraithwaite.com/projects/django-quiz">Django Quiz</a> project&nbsp;today:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey Myles, I believe I&#8217;m going to checkout your django quiz. Can you explain what&nbsp;the</p>
<p>{% if score.corrent_anwsers|intequaltest:question %}
This wont work
{% endif %}
is doing? It looks really&nbsp;good!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First I just like to say I love talking to people so if you ever have a question for me about anything (literally) don&#8217;t hesitate emailing me (<a href="mailto:me@mylesbraithwaite.com">me@mylesbraithwaite.com</a>) or chatting with me (<span class="caps">XMPP</span>/GTalk <a href="mailto:me@mylesbraithwaite.com">me@mylesbraithwaite.com</a>).</p>
<p %="" endhighlight="">{% highlight python %}
def intequaltest(value, arg):
    return (value ==&nbsp;arg)</p>
<p>Okay so <code>intequaltest</code> is got to be the studied template tag in the world. It&#8217;s sole purpose is to see if two things (i.e. a <code>list</code>, <code>str</code>, <code>dict</code>, etc.) are the same and if they are return <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>. In this case see if the correct answer is equal to the answer they gave. I will go into the history a little later in this post but essentially this application use to work a lot differently and the only reason this template tag is in here is because I have an issue with copying and&nbsp;pasting.</p>
<p>When I first started developing the Django Quiz application in 2008 it was for a client. They wanted to quiz their sales consultants on very complex financial process. The consultants could take each quiz as many times as they want, but their &#8220;score&#8221; wouldn&#8217;t be submitted to their manager until they got&nbsp;prefix.</p>
<p>I spent about a two days in July (10th, and 11th) developing this application for the client. In the middle of my second day the client came to me and said they found a better solution, a pice of paper and a&nbsp;pencil.</p>
<p>I have been asked about this application five or six times in the last month, so I guess it is about time I write my formal apology. This application doesn&#8217;t work. I tried to start up again on April 28, but my heart isn&#8217;t really there anymore (my heart was not really there the first time but I was getting&nbsp;paid).</p>
<p>So will this application ever be completed? Maybe, if one day I wake up and get really excited about coding it again or a client comes along and ask me to code them a quiz&nbsp;application.</p>

		<p>Back in February I tweeted &#8220;Starting work on #Episteme today.&#8221;<a href="http://twitter.com/mylesb/status/8635677939" title="Tweet on 4th Feb 2010 at 10:17 AM">#</a>. A few hours latter I got the following query in an&nbsp;email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From: Ivan Avery Frey<br>

Subject: What&#8217;s Episteme???</br></br></br></p>
<p>Self-explanatory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Episteme</strong> is a wiki engine (more of a wiki library) I am currently working on (I have actually been working on it for the last two years). It was originally a fork of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/yaki/">Yaki</a> (which powers <a href="http://the.taoofmac.com/">The Tao of Mac</a>), then was powered by <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a>, and now is a fork of <a href="http://hatta.sheep.art.pl/">Hatta</a> (not so much as a fork because I am still going to be using Hatta&#8217;s <code>WikiStorage</code> module).</p>
<p>So why am I working on&nbsp;yet-another-wiki-engine?</p>
<ul>
<li>I like flat files (easy to backup using&nbsp;rsync).</li>
<li>I think that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system">Relation databases</a> (like MySQL and PostgreSQL) were not design for wiki&nbsp;documents.</li>
<li>I like storing the documents in a Revision Control System so I can edit them in a text&nbsp;editor.</li>
<li>I like being able to&nbsp;search.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t ware the same cloths every day why should I have to use the same markup&nbsp;language.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an example of a wiki&nbsp;document:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">Title</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">Python</span>
<span class="n">Tags</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">python</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">programming</span>

</pre></div>
<p>I am using <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc822/"><span class="caps">RFC822</span></a> (similar to an email) for meta information (title, tags, markup, date, author,&nbsp;etc).</p>
<p>Episteme will always be a work in progress and many never be&nbsp;released.</p>

		<p><strong>This is a blog post I wrote the a few weeks after iPad was shown to the world and never got around to publishing it on this blog. It was on an internal company blog though. Sorry for bring up such an old news&nbsp;item.</strong></p>
<p>A lot has been said the last two months about how Apple&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad" title="iPad">iPad</a> will kill the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle" title="Kindle">Kindle</a> and how the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone" title="iPhone">iPhone</a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch" title="iPod Touch">iPod Touch</a> has already killed Sony&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSP" title="Playstation Portable"><span class="caps">PSP</span></a> and Nintendo&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSi" title="Nintendo DSi">DSi</a> (because the iPad will be able to play games it will some how destroy a extremely large industry). Personally I never like the idea of a device that did it all, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifunction_printer" title="Multifunction Printer">Multi-Function Printers</a> always gave me a bad feeling why combine the three most complicated systems in an office Printer, Fax, and Copier? Yes I will be buying an iPad when it comes out (not sure if Wi-Fi or 3G) but I will not be replacing my Kindle that has a better screen for reading and it will not be replacing any of my portable video game systems. I will use the iPad for the purpose I believe is servers: a&nbsp;netbook.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@<a href="http://twitter.com/mylesb">mylesb</a> I hear they have the revolutionary feature of only allowing the user to run one application at a&nbsp;time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>At quote from <a href="http://twitter.com/cbbrowne">Chirs Browne</a>&#8216;s tweet on <a href="http://twitter.com/cbbrowne/status/8295800525">27th January 2010 at 1:46pm</a>.</em></p>
<p>Yes the iPad can only run one application at a time. But if I need to run more than one application at the same time I can easily take out my laptop. I see the iPad as more of a internet device than a&nbsp;computer.</p>

It is hosted in the same data centre (Newark, <span class="caps">NJ</span>) so I have an internal <span class="caps">IP</span> address connecting both of them.

Hatta is a really simple wiki engine written in Python that use Mercurial for storage. Which means I just have to clone a repository to edit a page (you can clone the <a href="http://bitbucket.org/myles/wiki-pages/">my draft wiki</a> or <a href="http://wiki.mylesbraithwaite.com/hg/">my published wiki</a>). I am going to miss some of the more powerful features of DokuWiki so I have started working on my own wiki engine called <strong>Episteme</strong>.</p>
<p>Episteme will have some of my favorite feature of DokuWiki, Hatta, <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/">Confluence</a>, and <a href="http://code.google.com/p/yaki/">Yaki</a>.</p>

		<p>Last night at <a href="http://pygta.org/2010-01/tornado/" title="PyGTA - Tornado Hacking">PyGTA</a>, <a href="http://blog.vrplumber.com/index.php?/archives/2418-Tornado-PyGTA-this-month,-PyCon-Dress-Rehearsal-next.html" title="Tornado @ PyGTA this month, PyCon Dress Rehearsal next">Mike</a> gave a short talk/demo about his
findings using <a href="http://tornadoweb.org">Tornado</a> and <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org">CouchDB</a> to write a
real time chat and voting application for <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2010/conference/talks/">his PyCon talk</a>.</p>
<p>Tornado is a lightweight non-blocking web server created by
<a href="http://bret.appspot.com/entry/tornado-web-server" title="The technology behind Tornado, FriendFeed's web server">FriendFeed</a> and Open Source by <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;story=301" title="Tornado: Facebook's Real-Time Web Framework for Python">Facebook</a>. The <span class="caps">API</span> is similar
to <a href="http://webpy.org/">web.py</a> and App Engine&#8217;s <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/news.php?blog=1&amp;story=301" title="Tornado: Facebook's Real-Time Web Framework for Python">webapp framework</a>. Mike&#8217;s ending comments was that Tornado can out perform Twisted. But
he found he had to write a lot of code to do things that were built
into Twisted (or any other modern web framework)&nbsp;already.</p>
<p>His thoughts on&nbsp;CouchDB:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m really beginning to regret the choice of CouchDB for the
back-end.  It&#8217;s working perfectly well, but I have literally dozens
of pieces of code hanging around for doing <span class="caps">SQL</span>-based paging&#8230; none
of which are applicable to&nbsp;CouchDB.</p>

My current setup is Apache2 and WSGI. -- on Twitter at 14th Jan 6:56 PM">#</a>. It
will still be built on top of <a href="http://djangoproject.org">Django</a> thought so most of the
issues Mike was talking about wouldn&#8217;t apply to&nbsp;me.</p>
