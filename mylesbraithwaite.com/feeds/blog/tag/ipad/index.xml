&lt;h2 id="mac-os-x-lion"&gt;Mac OS X Lion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lion is the seventh iteration of the Mac OS X operating system (which was released on the 24 March, 2001). To say Mac OS X is getting long in the tooth, would be an understatement, especial up against Windows 8's Metro U.I. (Metro is Microsoft answer to WebOS with a card layout system (if you had a beer or coffee with me in the past year or so and we were talking about U.I. design I would have brought up how awesome I think it is)).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One interesting feature of Lion is the full-screen API. It's nice to see a company finally get that humans can't multitask (no you can't (I know you think you can but you can't (&lt;a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95256794" title="Think You're Multitasking? Think Again"&gt;it's scientifically proven&lt;/a&gt;))). Right now I am actually writing this journal entry in a full-screen text editor called &lt;a href="http://www.iawriter.com/mac"&gt;iA Writer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Launchpad and Mission Control look cool but I have to use them to see if they are actually going to be useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ios-5"&gt;iOS 5&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple has now copied ever great feature from BlackBerry and Android and put them into iOS 5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="notifications"&gt;Notifications&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notifications were one of the weakest points in iOS. They are similar to Twitter tweets where you will only get information out of them when you are actually looking at your phone. The new notification system is pretty much a clone of Android (they actually got something right the first time).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="imessage"&gt;iMessage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;iMessage is a clone of BlackBerry Messenger which is a private, securer, and proprietary chat client. It is heavily used by suites and like Facebook if you aren't on it &lt;strong&gt;you have no social life&lt;/strong&gt; (I am a little bitter about this). I will never use iMessage because out of everyone I know (clients, colleagues, friends, enemies) &lt;strong&gt;I am the only one who uses an iPhone&lt;/strong&gt; (I am also a little bitter about this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="icloud"&gt;iCloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the idea of a Dropbox clone more integrated to the Operating System but I am a little scared of something I am not playing for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will probably buy the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>me@mylesbraithwaite.com (Myles Braithwaite)</author><pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2011 16:34:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://mylesbraithwaite.com/blog/2011/jun/6/wwdc-2011-keynote/</guid><category>WWDC</category><category>iPhone</category><category>Android</category><category>Apple</category><category>Steve Jobs</category><category>iOS</category><category>iPad</category></item><item><title>Some Thoughts on the iPad</title><link>http://mylesbraithwaite.com/blog/2010/mar/22/ipad/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is a blog post I wrote the a few weeks after iPad was shown to the world and never got around to publishing it on this blog. It was on an internal company blog though. Sorry for bring up such an old news item.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot has been said the last two months about how Apple's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad" title="iPad"&gt;iPad&lt;/a&gt; will kill the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle" title="Kindle"&gt;Kindle&lt;/a&gt; and how the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone" title="iPhone"&gt;iPhone&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPod_Touch" title="iPod Touch"&gt;iPod Touch&lt;/a&gt; has already killed Sony's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSP" title="Playstation Portable"&gt;PSP&lt;/a&gt; and Nintendo's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSi" title="Nintendo DSi"&gt;DSi&lt;/a&gt; (because the iPad will be able to play games it will some how destroy a extremely large industry). Personally I never like the idea of a device that did it all, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multifunction_printer" title="Multifunction Printer"&gt;Multi-Function Printers&lt;/a&gt; always gave me a bad feeling why combine the three most complicated systems in an office Printer, Fax, and Copier? Yes I will be buying an iPad when it comes out (not sure if Wi-Fi or 3G) but I will not be replacing my Kindle that has a better screen for reading and it will not be replacing any of my portable video game systems. I will use the iPad for the purpose I believe is servers: a netbook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;@&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/mylesb"&gt;mylesb&lt;/a&gt; I hear they have the revolutionary feature of only allowing the user to run one application at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At quote from &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cbbrowne"&gt;Chirs Browne&lt;/a&gt;'s tweet on &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/cbbrowne/status/8295800525"&gt;27th January 2010 at 1:46pm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes the iPad can only run one application at a time. But if I need to run more than one application at the same time I can easily take out my laptop. I see the iPad as more of a internet device than a computer.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>me@mylesbraithwaite.com (Myles Braithwaite)</author><pubDate>Mon, 22 Mar 2010 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://mylesbraithwaite.com/blog/2010/mar/22/ipad/</guid><category>iPad</category><category>Apple</category><category>Netbook</category><category>Tablet</category></item></channel></rss>
