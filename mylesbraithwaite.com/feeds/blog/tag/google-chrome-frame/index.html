&lt;a href="http://lizardwrangler.com/"&gt;Mitchell Baker&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://shaver.off.net/"&gt;Mike Shaver&lt;/a&gt;
Vice President Engineering criticised Google for their
&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/chromeframe/"&gt;Chrome Frame&lt;/a&gt;, an Internet Explorer add-on
that allows the use of the Google Chrome's layout engine instead of using Microsoft's
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_%28layout_engine%29"&gt;Trident&lt;/a&gt; layout engine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://shaver.off.net/diary/2009/09/28/thoughts-on-chrome-frame/"&gt;Mike Shaver&lt;/a&gt; is criticising Chrome Frame for loss of security controls and features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running Chrome Frame within IE makes many of the browser application’s
features non-functional, or less effective. These include private
browsing mode or their other security controls, features like
accelerators or add-ons that operate on the content area, or even
accessibility support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And &lt;a href="http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2009/09/28/browser-soup-and-chrome-frame/"&gt;Mitchell Baker&lt;/a&gt; is criticising Chrome Frame for the loss of control from the users perceptive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What rendering engine do you end up using? That depends on the
website now, not on you. And if you end up at a website that makes
use of the Chrome Frame, the treatment of your passwords, security
settings, personalization all the other things one sets in a browser
is suddenly unknown. Will sites you tag or bookmark while browsing
with one rendering engine show up in the other? Because the various
parts of the browser are no longer connected, actions that have one
result in the browser you think you’re using won’t have the same
result in the Chrome browser-within-a-browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I agree that the issue of security of Chrome Frame is a big one. But from the perspective
of a web developer this is the greatest thing that Google has released in a long time.
One issue that I run into writing web applications is cross-browser support because most
business management web software (CRMs, ERPs, Accounting, etc.) have be design to work with
IE 6 (and don't work with a modern web browser) it is difficult to tell someone you will
have to open Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome to visit the web page. So I have to spend
almost half my time writing IE support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way around this issue is the Firefox add-on &lt;a href="http://ietab.mozdev.org/"&gt;IE Tab&lt;/a&gt;
(which allows the user to render a web page using the Trident layout engine instead of the Mozilla's &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gecko_%28layout_engine%29"&gt;Gecko&lt;/a&gt; layout engine).
This plugin had a major design flaw it was targeted to the Power User which meant it was
extremely hard to train non-technical people to use the plugin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google Chrome Frame has taken the need for the user to switch the Layout Engine and has put
that power into the hands of web developers (which I admit is a bad thing). All I have to
do is add a simple meta tag to the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of the base template:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p %="" endhighlight=""&gt;{% highlight html %}
&lt;meta content="chrome=1" http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't think Google Chrome Frame is an elegant or technically sound solution but it is a
step in the right direction and hopefully it just might make Microsoft and more importantly
business management web software think that maybe they should start support the modern web.&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>me@mylesbraithwaite.com (Myles Braithwaite)</author><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2009 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://mylesbraithwaite.com/blog/2009/sep/30/google-chrome-frame/</guid><category>Google Chrome Frame</category><category>Microsoft</category><category>Internet Explore</category></item></channel></rss>
