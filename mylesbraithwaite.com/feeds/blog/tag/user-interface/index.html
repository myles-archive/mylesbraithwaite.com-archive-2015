&lt;p&gt;I signed up for &lt;a href="http://www.panic.com/blog/2009/12/transmit-beta-signup/"&gt;Transmit's Beta&lt;/a&gt; and it looks like they had a lot of people signed up and now the Beta program is full. So they sent me an email informing me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Sorry: the Transmit 4 beta group is full." src="http://uploads.mylesbraithwaite.com/blog_posts/179-took-note/automatied-eamil_small.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="lighthouse-strange-ui"&gt;Lighthouse strange UI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started using &lt;a href="http://lighthouseapp.com/"&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/a&gt; (a ticket tracker) a few days ago for &lt;a href="http://asgardproject.org/" title="Asgard Project"&gt;Asgard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href='http://i-del-icio-us.appspot.com/%20"An%20iPhone%20interface%20for%20Delicious'&gt;iDelicious&lt;/a&gt;, and a few other personal projects (while I wait for a new server to run &lt;a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/"&gt;Jira&lt;/a&gt;). Initial thoughts are it a really good, simple, easy to use ticket track. But as you can see from the screenshot below I always forget where the &lt;em&gt;Add new Ticket&lt;/em&gt; button is located. I look left under the bar that has a bunch of &lt;em&gt;New&lt;/em&gt; actions but I start freaking out because I don't see &lt;em&gt;New ticket&lt;/em&gt;, then I remember to look right where their is a prominent button that say &lt;em&gt;Create new ticket&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Where do I add a new Ticket in Lighthouse" src="http://uploads.mylesbraithwaite.com/blog_posts/179-took-note/lighthouse-how-add-ticket_small.png"/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So you have an input box that asks a simple question, What did you eat today for lunch? Your users enter what they ate for lunch and it post on the website. Simple eh. While your users want to be able to share what they ate for lunch with their friends so you add the ability to do that. Still pretty simple eh. Soon you might add cross tagging and the like to create pretty graphs and statistics to show that one of your users has eaten peanut butter and jelly for the last two years. Still some what simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common thing about the features added above is that they are all back-end features. You don't have to change you design to implement them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay so your little startup has become extremely popular and maybe it just got bought by some large corporation. One of your new co-workers keeps talking about how Ajax and how it is the future of web applications and your small fun application should change to a complex JavaScript version soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the issue that is facing many simple web applications. Lets take as an example &lt;a href="http://delicious.com/"&gt;Delicious&lt;/a&gt;. Why do Delicious users use Delicious? To keep a copy of their bookmarks in a central location. Sounds simple enough. Then why do they have to make it so JavaScript intensive. I use to be able to easily load Delicious on any mobile device (Nokia N800, iPhone, etc.) and it would work. But now it is pretty much unnavigable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is why I started &lt;a href="http://i-del-icio-us.appspot.com" rel="me"&gt;iDelicious&lt;/a&gt; a simple bare bones front-end to Delicious. No fancy JavaScript any where (while maybe &lt;a href="http://google.com/analytics"&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description><author>me@mylesbraithwaite.com (Myles Braithwaite)</author><pubDate>Thu, 26 Mar 2009 00:00:00 -0400</pubDate><guid>http://mylesbraithwaite.com/blog/2009/mar/26/complicated/</guid><category>Delicious</category><category>Complicated</category><category>User Interface</category></item></channel></rss>
